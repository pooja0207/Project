            &emsp;• <b>Long-term, trusted relationships helping to design and manage our clients’ most essential
              business processes</b>, giving us the ability to spot opportunities and understand the &emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;complexities of
            how organizations can take advantage of them<br>
            &emsp;• <b>An agile, diverse, born-global team</b> that combines a massive supply of technical capabilities in

            <p>A culture focused on client needs
              It’s paramount to our culture to be truly focused on our clients, and we believe it’s that culture that both
              sets us apart from our competitors and sets our way forward. That’s why one of our most meaningful
              measures of success is the reach and longevity of our client relationships. So many of our Global 2000
              clients rely on us to help build and run their most important business processes, as well as to help adapt
              their organizations to succeed in the future. These clients recognize us for our:<br>
              &emsp;• Client Focus: Our clients are our true north, and we are completely dedicated to meeting their
              needs and accomplishing their goals, going above and beyond whenever &emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;necessary. We value our
              clients’ satisfaction above all.<br>
              &emsp;• Empowerment: We’re all doers who live by “can do.” Whatever our role, we are all responsible for
              advancing the ambitions of our clients and our company, and we take &emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;the initiative to find the best
              ways to get the job done.<br>
              &emsp;• Passion: We love technology, and we’re optimistic about what it can do for our clients and the
              people they serve. We are called to contribute to solving some of the &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;world’s most challenging
              problems, and we do it by seeing possibilities as easily as limitations.<br>
              &emsp;• Collaboration: We work closely with our clients and each other, bringing diverse skillsets,
              communities and ideas together around common goals, working from places &emsp;&emsp;around the world as if
              we were together, and in whatever way is best for each of our clients.<br>
              &emsp;• Transparency: We work in an environment of open sharing—of information, positive or negative,
              and of ideas.<br>
              &emsp;• Integrity: We never compromise our integrity. We acknowledge and fix our mistakes, respect our
              clients’ and associates’ needs, and keep everyone’s best interests in &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mind.</p>
